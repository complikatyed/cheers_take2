# cheers_take2
NSS C8 - P2-W3 - The ruby cheers excercise (see: complikatyed/cheers), three weeks into Ruby, with tests.

## Instructions
(What are we supposed to do?)


## Specifications
(How does the program work?)

Start the program by running './cheers.rb'

The program should ask:
> Hello!  What is your name?

User types in name, for example:

> Eliza

The program outputs a cheer in the following form:


> Give me an... E
> Give me an... L
> Give me an... I
> Give me a...  Z
> Give me an... A
> Elizaâ€™s just GRAND!

* Follow the proper grammatical rules for a and an.
* Strip out all special characters (i.e., non-word characters)
* Ignore all special characters when printing the cheer (last line)
* Print the user's name as it was original input for the "just GRAND"
  line
* If there was no input, ask again until valid input is provided

After printing out the user's cheer, the program asks:

> Hey "name", what's your birthday? (mm/dd)

The user types in the birthdate.

> 08/25

* If there was no input, asks again until valid input is provided.
* If tehre was input that could not be parsed, the program says:

> I couldn't undestand that.  Could you give me your birthday in
> mm/dd format?

The program then outputs the number of days until the user's
birthday.

> Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days!  Happy Birthday in advance!
